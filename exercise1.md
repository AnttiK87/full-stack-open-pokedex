# 11.1 Warming up

Task was to discuss about some points how to set up CI/CD pipeline for development team about 6 persons using programming language other than JavaScript or TypeScript. I decided that in my case the team is using Ruby, because I basically don’t know anything about it. So that, I’ll get an even so slight understanding about it as well.

First point was to find out what tools there is available for Ruby for linting, testing and building it. After a Google search I stumbled upon a ruby linter called RuboCop. According to RuboCop documentation it seems to combine both linter and code formatter. It also seems to have quite vast integration to IDE’s including Visual Studio Code. For testing ruby code there seems to be two popular testing frameworks according to ruby-toolbox.com website. Those are rspec and minitest. Latter seems to be bit better maintained or at least it has more new releases towards current date and time. If Ruby is used for web development with ruby on rails framework it also includes own testing tools which uses minitest as default testing library. Build topic was bit trickier and I must admit that I didn’t quite understand it. But even thou ruby don’t need an actual building phase because it is interpreted language, and it is interpreted run time. For that there is tool integrated for ruby called CRuby which is a virtual machine (back in days Ruby MRI and currently YARV).

Google search gives some alternatives for setting up CI pipeline for ruby project e.g. circleCI and buddy.works. According to these tools web sites both seems to support projects executed with multiple different programming languages. CircleCI offers ready templates for configuring CI pipeline, but it must be modified for your purposes. CircleCi offers graphic web application for analysing results of deployment. Buddy works seems to have more graphical approach also for setting up the configurations. CircleCI has bit cryptic pricing plans which is based on credits charged according to usage. It offers also some free credits for trial or small usage purposes. Buddy.Works has trial version, monthly subscriptions and also pay as you go for cloud versions.

Both CI tools seem to have options for local hosted or cloud-based services. For small team and project cloud hosted solution might be right way to go. I assume that that way CI pipeline will be much easier and cheaper to set up. But scale of the project should be taken in consideration when choosing the solution. Also type of the project and requirements for data protection and information security affects if using cloud-based solution is possible.
